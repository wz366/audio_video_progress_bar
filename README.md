# audio_video_progress_bar

A progress bar widget to show or change the position of an audio or video stream.

***Note**: This package does not play audio or video itself. It's just a widget you can use to show the progress of your audio or video player. This widget is easier to connect to a media player than the Flutter Slider widget is. It also supports showing the buffered status for streamed media.*

## Example

Add the `ProgressBar` widget to your UI. A static example would look like this:

```dart
ProgressBar(
  progress: Duration(milliseconds: 1000),
  buffered: Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
  total: Duration(milliseconds: 5000),
  onSeek: (duration) {
    print('User selected a new time: $duration');
  },
),
```

However, you would normally wrap it in a builder widget that is updated by an audio or video player. That might look something like this:

```dart
StreamBuilder<DurationState>(
  stream: _durationState,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    final durationState = snapshot.data;
    final progress = durationState?.progress ?? Duration.zero;
    final buffered = durationState?.buffered ?? Duration.zero;
    final total = durationState?.total ?? Duration.zero;
    return ProgressBar(
      progress: progress,
      buffered: buffered,
      total: total,
      onSeek: (duration) {
        _player.seek(duration);
      },
    );
  },
),

...

class DurationState {
  const DurationState({this.progress, this.buffered, this.total});
  final Duration progress;
  final Duration buffered;
  final Duration total;
}
```

You can check out the GitHub repo for the full [example](https://github.com/suragch/audio_video_progress_bar/tree/master/example) using the [just_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio) plugin. There is no requirement to use `just_audio` or even a `StreamBuilder`, though. You can use any audio or video player that provides updates about the current play location. Just rebuild the `ProgressBar` widget with the new `Duration` states.

You'll probably want to add other buttons like start and pause, but these are not included with this package. They aren't hard to build, though, and you can find an example in the GitHub repo.

Thanks to the [just_audio code example](https://github.com/ryanheise/just_audio/blob/master/just_audio/example/lib/main.dart) for help with the buttons.

## Customization

The default colors use the theme's primary color, so changing the theme will also update this widget:

However, you can set your own colors and sizes as well:

```dart
ProgressBar(
  progress: progress,
  buffered: buffered,
  total: total,
  progressBarColor: Colors.red,
  baseBarColor: Colors.white.withOpacity(0.24),
  bufferedBarColor: Colors.white.withOpacity(0.24),
  thumbColor: Colors.white,
  barHeight: 3.0,
  thumbRadius: 5.0,
  onSeek: (duration) {
    _player.seek(duration);
  },
);
```

Which would look like this (if the app has a dark theme):

You can also set the location of the time labels:

```dart
ProgressBar(
  ...
  timeLabelLocation: TimeLabelLocation.sides,
);
```

Now the time labels are displayed on the side:

## New feature requests

There are a number of interesting feature requests in the GitHub issues. Unfortunately, with the other projects I have going on, I generally don't get around to implementing very many of them. Your best bet is to copy the source code and implement the feature yourself. On the other hand, if the issue you is important enough to you or your company, I'm open to being hired to add your desired feature to this package or to create a custom solution.
